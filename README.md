My solutions for the Advent of Code 2019.

# Running

This is a Rust project, so you'll need a recent version of Rust installed. You'll also need to install `cargo-aoc` by running `cargo install cargo-aoc` (add a `--force` if you had it installed from previous years). 

Once you've got that, you can run the latest day's code with:

```
cargo aoc
```

See here for more information about `cargo-aoc`: https://github.com/gobanos/cargo-aoc
